# get_next_line | EXPLAINED EDITION
My second project for 42. This project is quite a spike in difficulty, so the files include a lot of commentaries to guide you through this logic.

I recommend you to download the files and open them in VSC or Vim for a better view at the texts. Github make them ugly as heck and I don't feel like learning how the hell github deals with tabs and stuff.
If you have any trouble or questions, message me in Slack @fpereira.
