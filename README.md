## üó£Ô∏è About

I saw a lot of my friends and other colleagues having problems with this project. Mainly because it's quite the spike in difficulty, considering we were doing simple functions on the last one. Also, 42 the first experience of many in coding, so even understanding what to do was difficult. So I took matter in hands while I had free time and made a tutorial. It's simple: open the main file (_get_next_line.c_), follow the commentaries and that's it.

It also includes the bonus, which consisted of doing the same thing - but with different file descriptors at the same time.

For more information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/52102/en.subject.pdf).

If you are a student at 42 and are having any trouble or questions, message me in Slack @fpereira.
