# get_next_line | EXPLAINED EDITION
My second project for 42. This project is quite a spike in difficulty, so the files include a lot of commentaries to guide you through this logic.

The formatting of the commentaries are weird at times, but it do be like that sometimes...
If you have any trouble or questions, message me in Slack @fpereira.
