# get_next_line
My second project for 42. This project is quite a spike in difficulty, so the files include a lot of commentaries to guide you through this logic.

I recommend you to download the files and open them in VSC or Vim for a better view at the texts. Github make them ugly as heck.
If you have any trouble or questions, message me in slack @fpereira.
